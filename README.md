# Finite element analysis(FEA) : inpfile converter (dotTo3D) using Matlab
converting dataset into inp.file(abaqus environment)

- This file and code illustrates how to convert the original dataset which is organized in dot method into voxel(cubic) dataset.

- You can either convert dataset into inp file with creation code and write that in txt file with write code.

- The original dataset has not been uploaded since copyright of the original dataset file is under the Korea Institute of Materials Science(KIMS).
  So unfortunately, it does not work for your dataset directly.
  
- But it may help for you to make use of the code logic.
