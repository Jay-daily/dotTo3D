# inpfile converter (dotTo3D) using Matlab
converting dataset into inp.file(abaqus environment)

- This file and code illustrates how to convert the original dataset which is organized in dot method into voxel(cubic) dataset.

- You can either convert dataset into inp file with creation code and write that in txt file with write code.

- The original dataset has not been uploaded since copyright of the original dataset file is under the Korea Institute of Materials Science(KIMS)

- Finite element analysis(FEA) concept is used.
